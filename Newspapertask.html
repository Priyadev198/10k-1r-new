<h5>
Ram Mandir: Ayodhya puts spiritual apps on a growth curve

</h5>

<p>
Ahead of the Ram Mandir consecration in Ayodhya, religious and spiritual apps such as Vama, DevDham, UtsavApp, SriMandir are witnessing a major uptick in organic searches and a growth in demand for their products and services.

"This is our Paytm moment of demonetisation and the biggest event for anyone in this space..,” said Manu Jain, cofounder of Vama, a New Delhi-based startup which offers access to virtual pujas (religious ceremonies), darshans, and astrology services to devotees from across India and the world.

He was referring to the Indian government’s November 2016 demonetisation of high-value currency notes, which triggered a surge in usage for firms like Paytm, marking a significant shift towards digital payments in India.

In the context of the Ram Mandir inauguration in Ayodhya on Monday, Jain said there has been a 35% increase in organic searches on Vama this month, with a growing number of people seeking pujas.

India’s burgeoning segment of religious and spiritual apps, which has seen investors including Peak XV Partners, Elevation Capital, Titan Capital and India Quotient backing startups in the last few years, is expected to get a boost from the Ram Mandir inauguration, multiple founders and investors in the space told ET.

Amidst the sea of devotees that are expected to be drawn to Ayodhya following the inauguration, several spiritual and astrology platforms are actively participating in the event,while witnessing a growth in demand for their products and services.

Greek PM plans India trip in Feb as India's Mediterranean outreach gathers momentum

</h6>
<p>
New Delhi: Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Prime Minister of Greece, is planning an India trip next month, a little over six months since PM Narendra Modi visited Athens to elevate ties to strategic partnership.
Greece has emerged as a key anchor for India's outreach to the Mediterranean region as New Delhi seeks presence at Greek ports and wider defence partnership. Greece could be the first point of call for the India Middle East Europe Corridor in Europe. It may be pointed out that while India has steadfastly supported Greece on the question of Northern Cyprus, Athens has historically backed India’s position on the Kashmir issue.

Serving a message: Creativity on India, US platter can dish out potent solution

</h8>

<p>
The India-US trade conversation is always a tricky territory to navigate. But the needle can be moved when both sides talk to each other, rather than at each other - a fact that US trade representative Kathreen Tai literally discovered on her dinner plate during her recent visit.
During a recent visit, US Trade Representative Kathreen Tai experienced nuanced messages on India-US trade through her banquet menu. The inclusion of Indian wild-caught shrimps, usually prohibited under US law due to concerns about sea turtles, signaled potential collaboration in overcoming regulatory challenges. The second message was represented by grapes served with Angoori Rasmalai, symbolizing unresolved issues, such as market access barriers for Indian grapes.

India's forex reserves up $1.6 bn to $618.94 bn as of Jan 12

</h9>

<p>
India's foreign exchange reserves saw a mild uptick of $1.6 billion to $618.94 billion as of January 12, 2024, the Reserve Bank of India said on Friday.

The forex reserves had declined sharply by $5.89 billion in the week ending January 5 after rising for four straight weeks.
In October 2021, India’s foreign exchange reserves had hit a record peak at $645 billion. However, these reserves saw a decline as the central bank utilised them to safeguard a falling Rupee, addressing pressures primarily stemming from global events since the previous year.

<p>
Forty years after igniting a PC revolution, Apple's Mac is stronger than ever and could reach new glory due to AI computing -- or be left behind. Even Apple's soon to be released "spacial computing" headgear, the Vision Pro, plays up work-related uses -- and its compatibility with the Mac.

Forty years after igniting a PC revolution, Apple's Mac is stronger than ever and could reach new glory due to AI computing -- or be left behind.

Apple launched the Macintosh in 1984 with a history-making television ad pitching the machine as an anti-establishment blow against a dystopian future.

</h17>

<p>
Australia has paused applications for individuals who invest more than A$5 million ($3.3 million) into the country as part of a broader immigration policy overhaul designed to entice more skilled migrants.
